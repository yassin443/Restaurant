    <h3>lorem upsum who never around me </h3>
    <p>Lalla Meriem was born from a deep love for Algerian culinary traditions and family heritage. Inspired by recipes passed down through generations, our restaurant was created to preserve the authentic flavors of Algeria while sharing them with a modern audience.<br>
    Our concept is simple: authentic Algerian cuisine made with care and respect for tradition.
We focus on traditional recipes prepared with fresh ingredients, slow cooking, and homemade techniques that reflect the true spirit of Algerian gastronomy<br>
We believe that food is a powerful way to connect people.
That is why we place great importance on hospitality, attention to detail, and respect for our customers.
At Lalla Meriem, every guest is welcomed like family, and every meal is served with sincerity and pride in our Algerian identity
